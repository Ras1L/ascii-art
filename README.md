# ascii-art
This program converts the image to ASCII characters, as the name implies. A simple alphabet of symbols is used [" ", ".", ",", "-", "~", "+", "=", "@"].

# disadvantages
The image may be too large to display in the console, so increase the scale argument of the function called from main(), it is responsible for how many pixels will be skipped at each iteration of reading the image.<br /><br />
For reasons unknown to me so far, some images may not be opened by the program
